			<h1>13 Species Of Lions that are Alive or Extinct</h1>
			<br>
			<h2>1.Asiatic lion</h2>
			<p style="text-align: justify; margin-right:20px;">The Asiatic lion (Panthera leo persica) is native to India, although today it can be found in zoos and reserves in various parts of the world.

	This variety is smaller than other types of lions and has a lighter coat, with reddish mane in males. The Asiatic lion is currently among the types of lion 
	in danger of extinction, mainly due to the reduction of their habitat,
	poaching and rivalry with inhabitants of their environment.

			<h2>2. West African lion</h2>
			<p style="text-align: justify; margin-right:20px;">Panthera leo melanochaitus, referred to more commonly as the Black lion or cape lion, 
			is a subspecies that was declared extinct in 1860. Before disappearing completely, this lion species inhabited the southwest of South Africa.
			Little is known about this lion species expect that they weighed between 150 and 250 kilos and lived alone, contrary to common lion packs today.

	The males had a black mane, hence their name. The black lion disappeared from the African continent during English colonization, as a 
	result of human attacks. Despite its extinction,
	lions in the Kalahari region are considered to have a genetic load from the black lion species.

			<h2>3. Eurasian cave lion</h2>
			<p style="text-align: justify; margin-right:20px;">Panthera leo spelaea, also referred to as the Eurasian cave lion, was a species that was found
			in the Iberian Peninsula, England and Alaska. This lion subspecies inhabited the Earth during the Pleistocene, 2.60 million years ago. Evidence of
			its existence lies in cave paintings from 30,000 years ago and fossils.

	In general, its characteristics were similar to those of the current lion: between 2.5 and 3 meters long,
	and 200 kilos in weight.

	<h2>4. American lion</h2>
			<p style="text-align: justify; margin-right:20px;">Panthera leo atrox, also known as the American lion, was distributed throughout North America.
			Many believe this occured when it arrived through the Bering Strait before the continental drift occurred. Additionally, records imply that the American
			lion may have been the largest lion species in history, having measured almost 4 meters in length, at a weight of between 350 and 400 kilos.

	According to cave paintings found, this subspecies lacked a mane or was very scarce. It disappeared during the mass megafauna extinction,
	 which occurred in the Quaternary.

	<h2>5. Katanga lion</h2>
			<p style="text-align: justify; margin-right:20px;">Among the types of lions and their characteristics we have the Kantaga lion, also referred to as the
			Southwest (Panthera leo bleyenberghi). This large lion subspecies is capable of reaching up to 280 kilograms in weight.

	As for its appearance, the Kantaga lion stands out for its characteristic sand colored thick and imposing mane. The outermost area of the mane can appear in a 
	combination of light brown, coffee-colored.

	<h2>6. Congo Lion</h2>
			<p style="text-align: justify; margin-right:20px;">The Congo lion (Panthera leo azandica), also known as the central African lion,
			is a lion subspecies distributed along the plains of the African continent, especially in Uganda and the Republic of the Congo.

	The Congo lion is characterized by a measurement of between 2 meters and 50 centimeters and/or 2 meters 80 centimeters. In addition,
	 this lion subspecies can weigh between 150 and 190 kilos. Male congo lions are recognizable by their dark characteristic mane,
	 less leafy than other lion varieties. Its fur color can range between sand and dark brown.

	<h2>7. Transvaal lion</h2>
			<p style="text-align: justify; margin-right:20px;">The Panthera leo krugeri, more commonly referred to as the Transvaal lion,
			is from South Africa. This African lion is a variety from the southern part of Africa, and is considered the sister lion to the Katanga lion.
			Male Transvaal lion species can reach up to 2 meters and 50 centimeters in length.

	Although they have the typical sand color in the fur, there are rare white lions from this variety. The white lion is a mutation of the krugeri,
	 and the white fur appears as a result of a recessive gene. Despite their noticeable beauty, the white lion is vulnerable in the wild,
	 especially because its light color is difficult to camouflage in the savanna.

	<h2>8. Barbary lion</h2>
			<p style="text-align: justify; margin-right:20px;">The Barbary lion (Panthera leo leo), is a subspecies that became extinct around 1942. There are,
			however, some specimens that can be found in zoos, such as those found in Rabat (Morocco). However,
			crossing with other lion subspecies complicates the task of raising pure Barbary lion individuals.

	According to records, this subspecies would be one of the largest, characterized by a large and lush mane.
	 They live in both the Savannah and African jungles.

	<h2>9. East African lion</h2>
			<p style="text-align: justify; margin-right:20px;">Another of the types of lions that still exist is Panthera leo nubica,
			also recognized as the East African lion. Its body weight ranges between an average of the lion species, that is,
			between 150 and 200 kilos. The male of this subspecies has an abundant and darker mane than other lion subspecies.

	<h2>10. Cape lion</h2>
			<p style="text-align: justify; margin-right:20px;">The Cape lion was a distinctive population of lions in South Africa's
			Natal and Cape Provinces that was extirpated in the mid-19th century. The type specimen originated at the Cape of Good Hope and was described in 1842.
			Traditionally, the Cape lion was considered a distinct subspecies of lion, Panthera leo melanochaita. However,
			phylogeographic analysis has shown that lion populations in Southern and East Africa are closely related. In 2017,
			the subspecies Panthera leo melanochaita was recircumscribed to include all lion populations in Southern and East Africa.

	<h2>11. Beringian lion</h2>
			<p style="text-align: justify; margin-right:20px;">The Beringian lion (Panthera leo spelaea) was the largest and most abundant cat of ice age Yukon,
			and a member of the well-known "cave lions" from Europe and Asia. Lion fossil bones from Beringia are smaller than the rest of the European cave lions,
			suggesting that they could be a seperate sub-species.

	<h2>12. Mosbach lion</h2>
			<p style="text-align: justify; margin-right:20px;">Panthera leo fossilis, also known as the Early Middle Pleistocene European cave lion,
			is an extinct feline of the Pleistocene epoch. It is generally considered to be an early subspecies of the lion (Panthera leo).
			With a maximum head and body length of 2.40 meters, which is about half a meter longer than today's African lions,
			Panthera leo fossilis was almost as big as the American lion from the Upper Pleistocene.

	<h2>13. Natodomeri lion</h2>
			<p style="text-align: justify; margin-right:20px;">The partial skull of a lion from Natodomeri, northwest Kenya is described.
			The Natodomeri sites are correlated with Member I of the Kibish Formation, dated to between 195 ka and ca. 205 ka.
			The skull is remarkable for its very great size, equivalent to the largest cave lions (Panthera spelaea [Goldfuss, 1810])
			of Pleistocene Eurasia and much larger than any previously known lion from Africa, living or fossil. We hypothesize that this individual
			represents a previously unknown population or subspecies of lion present in the late Middle and Late Pleistocene of eastern Africa rather 
			than being an indication of climate-driven size increase in lions of that time. This raises questions regarding the extent of our understanding
			of the pattern and causes of lion evolution in the Late Pleistocene.
